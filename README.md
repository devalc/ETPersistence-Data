# ETPersistence-Data

This repository contains the data used in the manuscript titled *"Persistence patterns in subfield-field crop water use to guide variable rate management."*

## Contents of the Repository

### 1. COG (Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs)
This folder contains three Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs):

- **`persistence_new_RAT_lyr_magicValley_1986_2020_cog.tif`**  
  Displays areas within the agricultural fields of Magic Valley that, relative to the field average, exhibit persistently different or similar crop water use.

- **`difference_new_RAT_lyr_magicValley_1986_2020_cog.tif`**  
  Shows all areas within the field that demonstrate persistently higher or lower than field-average crop water use.

- **`difference_5percent_new_RAT_lyr_magicValley_1986_2020_cog.tif`**  
  Highlights areas within the field that have persistently higher or lower than field-average crop water use by at least 5%.

These layers can be visualized through the **Google Earth Engine application** at the following link:

### 2. Field_Boundaries
This folder contains a layer that provides following information at each field in Magic Valley:
- Dominant crop type  
- Irrigation status  
- Percent persistence
